My AI Usage

In this project, I made medium use of AI tools to support my development process. The main tools I used were ChatGPT and Cursor.

🔧 Tools Used

ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)

Cursor AI Editor

💡 How I Used Them

I used ChatGPT to:

Get help with debugging backend errors in FastAPI and MongoDB integration.

Clarify how to structure my API routes and connect them with the frontend.

Understand and fix dependency or environment issues such as missing Python packages or NoneType database errors.

Generate example code snippets and improve code readability.

I used Cursor as an AI-powered coding assistant inside my IDE to:

Autocomplete repetitive code segments and boilerplate (e.g., data models, CRUD operations).

Suggest better naming conventions and refactor simple logic.

Generate docstrings and inline comments for key functions.
